PyDy
=====

A Python library for studying dynamics.

0. Download
-----------

$ git clone git://github.com/hazelnusse/pydy.git

1. Documentation and usage
--------------------------
This is a work in progress.  Much more will be added here as the project
matures.  Eventually, the project will have a Google code project page, either
within the Sympy page or a stand alone, separate project page.

2. Project goals
----------------
To allow for easy manipulation of three-dimensional vectors for the purpose of
deriving equations of motion.  In particular, PyDy is designed to implement
Kane's method for forming the equations of motion.  Numerical integration of
the equations of motion are provided by scipy.integrate.odeint.  PyDy has builtin
functionality that allows for easy animation of reference frames, points, rigid
bodies and particles.

3. Installation
---------------

PyDy requires sympy for its symbolic manipulation.  You can clone the sympy git repository by typing:

$ git clone git://git.sympy.org/

Then, install sympy by:

$ python setup.py install

See docs.sympy.org for more installation options.  You can also just download
the binary files from sympy.org, these should work just fine.

Next, clone the PyDy repository by:

$ git clone git://github.com/hazelnusse/pydy.git

System wide install:

$ python setup.py install

To install in your own special folder, use the --home option:

$ python setup.py install --home=~/usr

4.  Running Tests
-----------------

Currently, we use nose to test all of PyDy's functionality:

$ nosetests

This runs all the files in the ./tests folder
